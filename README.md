# Mech-105-Algorithms
This repository contains all the algorithms, MATLab, I created and submitted for the class Mech 105 at CSU. These algorithms include:
### False Position
"falsePosition.m"
This algorithm uses the false position method to find roots.
### LU Algorithm
"luFactor.m"
This algorithm is made to perform LU Factorization.
### Simpson's Algorithm
"Simpson.m"
This algorithm is made to perform Simpson's 1/3 Rule.
